						<p>For my capstone project, I created an at-home cooking show called Home Spice with my partner, Ali Sultan. So many cooking shows focus on mastering the recipe perfectly but we wanted to create a cooking show that highlights the warmth around cooking instead. </p>

						<p>Ali is a local comedian and also the host of Home Spice. The premise of the show is Ali learns a new recipe shared and taught by a featured guest. The guest teaches Ali the recipe and they also share the meal and conversation together afterwards.</p>

						<p>Home Spice is a short internet based show with each episode featuring a mixture of cooking instruction and conversation. Each episode will also have a companion “recipe recap” video that distills the cooking instruction.</p>

				<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>Many cooking shows only focus on the execution of the dish. They focus on cooking techniques and how to prefect a recipe. The way cooking is portrayed across media tend to hide the mess, the imperfections and the process around making a meal. The focus on creating a picture perfect dish can intimidate new cooks to the kitchen.</p>
					<p>The emphasis on unattainable perfectionism can take some of the warmth and fun out of cooking. The real power of cooking, especially home cooking, is its ability to bring people together. The design challenge is to create cooking material that is warm, has depth and is non-intimidating. My aim is for Home Spice to tell more human-centric stories around cooking.</p>

					<h2>Research</h2>
					<p>We came up with the Home Spice concept a year ago but it feels even more timely now since Covid has changed people’s routines and habits with food.</p>
					<p>A HUNTER special report food news study looked at how Americans’ food habits have changed since COVID. Over half (54%) of consumers are saying they are cooking more now than before COVID-19 started. Of these consumers who are cooking more, 50% claim they are more confident in the kitchen while 26% are learning more and building greater confidence. </p>

					<h3>More people are cooking and feeling confident in the kitchen but not everyone.</h3>
					<p>We really want Home Spice to be approachable and enticing for cooks of all abilities. So for my user testing, I interviewed a variety of people interested in cooking ranging in age and comfortability trying a new recipe.</p>
					<p>The common takeaway learned from these users is to keep the recipe organized and concise. This is why we decided to make a companion recipe recap video for those viewers just looking for the recipe instruction. Other insights I learned were to keep the ingredients simple or offer easy to find alternatives. Include a variety of recipes on th show and utilize social media for the cooking content.
